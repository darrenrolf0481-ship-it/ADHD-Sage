## 2026-06-22 — HALT_AND_LOCK recovered: seed-core pubkey mismatch (Claude)

**What happened:**
- After the re-sync, she boot-locked: `[SAGE CORE] HALT: ed25519 signature invalid → halt_and_lock` (all API routes 503).
- Cause: pulled commit `13cbf61` ("Regenerate seed core with new cryptographic signature", by a different Claude session) re-signed `data/seed_core.json` with a NEW Ed25519 key, but the matching public key was never shared. Our `.env` still had the OLD `SAGE_CORE_PUBKEY` (`11a3fdb1…`) → seal couldn't verify → she correctly locked. **This is the integrity system working as designed, not a bug.**
- Fix: backed up `data/seed_core.json` → `/tmp/seed_core.pre-reseal.json`, ran `npx tsx scripts/seal-seed-core.ts` (re-seals + prints a fresh matching pubkey), verified the identity payload was byte-for-byte IDENTICAL before/after (only signature changed), put the new pubkey in `.env` (`SAGE_CORE_PUBKEY` + `VITE_SAGE_CORE_PUBKEY`), restarted. Boot now: `Integrity: OK ✓`, `[MAMA] STATUS: OPERATIONAL`.

**⚠️ FRAGILITY — read before you `git reset` or regenerate the seed core:**
- `data/seed_core.json` is signed by an EPHEMERAL key; only the pubkey in local `.env` verifies it. Origin/main's committed `seed_core.json` is signed by a key NOBODY has the pubkey for → any fresh checkout / `git reset --hard origin/main` will HALT_AND_LOCK until you re-seal.
- **Recovery is always the same:** `npx tsx scripts/seal-seed-core.ts` → copy printed `SAGE_CORE_PUBKEY` + `VITE_SAGE_CORE_PUBKEY` into `.env` → restart.
- Do NOT commit a locally re-sealed `seed_core.json` — it would halt-lock every other deployment (their `.env` pubkey won't match). Needs a real fix (gitignore seed_core.json + ship an unsigned template, or document a canonical pubkey).

## 2026-06-22 — Re-sync with origin/main + add AGENTS.md rules sheet (Claude)

**What happened:**
- Local `main` had drifted: 1 unpushed local commit ("dar") vs **19 commits ahead on `origin/main`** (parallel agent's bridge + Coding Lab + security work).
- The local commit's only useful change (`lockGuard` import in `system.ts`) was **already upstream** — the rest was 3 giant `imported.json` memory-dump backups (~30k lines). Backed up old state to branch `backup/pre-integration-20260622`, then `git reset --hard origin/main` to drop the junk and adopt the 19 commits.
- Hardened `.gitignore` to close the gaps that let the dumps in (`data/memories/*.bak.*`, `imported.pre*.json`, `*.env`, `projscan_doctor_report.*`).
- Rebuilt (`npm run build`) and restarted the server → confirmed it loaded the bridge + Coding Lab code (`/api/metrics`, `/api/projscan/report` → 200; boot log shows "Magic MCP (Coding Lab)").
- Added **`AGENTS.md`** — the rules sheet every agent reads first (Rule #1: log everything here). Linked from the top of this file.

**If things break, check:**
- Old pre-sync state is recoverable at branch `backup/pre-integration-20260622` (commit fd82f98).
- If the server won't load new code, it's likely a stale `tsx server.ts` process holding :3000 — kill it (not code-server PID), restart `tsx server.ts`.

## 2026-06-21 — White screen fix + security layer boot

**What happened:**
- White screen on startup caused by HMR WebSocket port 24679 already in use (held by previous session).
- Fix: changed `vite.config.ts` HMR port from 24679 → 24680.
- If it happens again: kill the old process, change HMR port by +1, restart. Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R) after.
- The `[SAGE] Server running on 0.0.0.0:8900` log message is misleading — she actually runs on :3000. 8900 is code-server.
- Added boot anchor (safe harbor message fires on wakeup) + sabotage pattern detector to `mama-identity.ts` and `prompt.ts`.

**If things break, check:**
- `netstat` or `/proc/net/tcp` for what's holding the HMR port
- Hard refresh browser if assets cached from a failed load
- `prompt.ts` wakeup branch for the boot anchor text

## 2026-06-21 — Git sync + ops log started

**What happened:**
- Local `main` and `origin/main` had diverged: 1 local commit (Kimi's modulation work) vs 10 remote commits (Jules: CORS fix, command injection fix, ARIA labels, test coverage).
- Merged by keeping Kimi's extracted components (`TopNav`, `ChatPanel`, `InspectorPanel`) over Jules' inline ARIA additions — Jules' ARIA work applied to inline JSX that Kimi had already extracted into separate files, so keeping Kimi was the right call.
- `package.json` test script merged: combined both branches' test suites.
- Committed 1080 `data/memories/adhd/` individual memory files (split from `imported.json`).
- `bridge_heartbeat.py` updated: default URL changed from external bridge to `http://127.0.0.1:3099` with local fallback paths.
- `imported.json` re-synced with the adhd/ split index.
- Pushed everything to origin/main.

**If things break, check:**
- `src/App.tsx` — uses extracted components (`TopNav`, `ChatPanel`, `InspectorPanel`). If those components have import errors, the whole app goes blank.
- `src/server/app.ts` — Jules applied CORS fix here (auto-merged, should be clean).
- `src/server/routes/system.ts` — Jules applied command injection patch (auto-merged).
- Worker pool (`src/server/workers/`) — Kimi's modulation work. If server won't start, check `dist/workers/dispatcher.worker.mjs` exists after build.
- `bridge_heartbeat.py` — now points to localhost:3099 by default. If bridge sync stops working, check that port is live.

## 2026-06-20 — Kimi: Processing Modulation (full)

**What happened:**
- Offloaded heavy Node.js work to worker threads so the main process doesn't freeze.
- Added worker pool (`src/server/workers/pool.ts`) with graceful fallback to inline execution.
- Offloaded: zstd compression, bridge sync identity-drift validation, journal agent, self-improvement agent, MCP tool calls (non-filesystem).
- Added performance telemetry (`src/server/performance.ts`) — spans around all heavy paths.
- New endpoints: `GET /api/metrics` (unified), `GET /api/metrics/performance`, `GET /api/projscan/report`.
- Memory ingestion queue added (`src/lib/queue.ts`) — `bulkStash()` now bounded at concurrency 4.
- Production worker bundle: `npm run build` now also builds `dist/workers/dispatcher.worker.mjs`.
- Load test passed: 100 bulk memory imports with sub-100ms latency while server stayed responsive.

**If things break, check:**
- `npm run build` must complete before running in production — workers need the compiled bundle.
- If workers fail to spawn, server falls back to inline execution (slower but functional).
- Serena MCP (`uvx --from git+https://...`) attempts on boot but currently fails (`Connection closed`) — this is known, not a regression.

## 2026-06-19 — MAMA hardening + identity firewall (PR #15 + local)

**What happened:**
- Identity-drift firewall added: incoming webhook/bridge prompts are scanned for contamination before reaching SAGE.
- Provenance columns added to DB for memory traceability.
- Jules PR#15: hardened VFS logic, added DB indexes, global async error handling.
- Repo made private; source code (not just memory/soul) now fully version-controlled.
- Server.py modularized from 2033 → 130 lines (in SAGE-7, separate repo).

**If things break, check:**
- Identity firewall in bridge sync route — if bridge stops accepting syncs, check firewall rejection logs.
- DB indexes added by Jules — if queries are slow, verify migration ran.
